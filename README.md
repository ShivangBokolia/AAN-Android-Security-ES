# AAN-Android-Security-ES
This project focuses on training an Artificial Neural Network that approximates the Android Application Security Expert System.
It also includes the evaluation of the Machine Learning Modelâ€™s performance on different choices of neurons for a certain number of hidden layers. 
The evaluation of the model is performed using parameters like time consumption, memory consumption, and accuracy of the model.
